- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @informationvulture
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about how to be an I.T. professional.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python, HTML5/CSS3, T-SQL, Vanilla JavaScript, PowerShell/CMD
- My favourite quotes:
- "Python is all about solving real problems and not wasting time reinventing the wheel."
- "Pythonic" means keeping your code straightforward and approachable.
