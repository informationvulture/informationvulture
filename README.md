- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @informationvulture
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about how to be an I.T. professional.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python, HTML5/CSS3, T-SQL, Vanilla JavaScript, PowerShell/CMD
- My favourite quotes:
- "Python is all about solving real problems and not wasting time reinventing the wheel."
- "Pythonic" means keeping your code straightforward and approachable.
- "General Tips:

The act of asking a question when you are stuck has two advantages:

    The process of forming the question has a high chance of leading you to the answer, so you may end up never having to ask your question
    By converting a problem into a question, you no longer have a problem, instead you now have a question, and someone is bound to have an answer!

Software eng tip(s):

    When assigned the task of implementing a new feature or improving an existing one, consult your nearest domain expert before consulting Google. A domain expert could be a co-worker with experience in that area, or whoever had worked on the feature you are trying to improve.
        When a domain expert does not exist, then you and your team are in no position to undertake such a task. Forget Google at this point, you all need to have a serious meeting to determine a new solution for the task at hand.
    As a new developer, practice the art of asking questions. If you go three days working on a ticket and never ask a question, you are in danger of making a costly mistake."
